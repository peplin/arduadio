FM Transmitter on Arduino
=========================

* Use the PWM to create an output wave
* Pass the output voltage through a low pass filter using two poles
* Use a queue for packets scheduled to send

trackuino has a nice implementation of AX.25
many rtty libraries available if that's overkill

need to shift between 2 tones in the audio output. can either:

* connect to a PWM
* use a voltage divider on a digital output

## Voltage divider method

then use this library: https://github.com/jonsowman/librtty

how do we make that async with interrupts?

create a timer interrupt to match the baud rate
or keep track of when last bit was sent, and don't send another bit until time
is up - might be simpler and still allows loop() to continue
